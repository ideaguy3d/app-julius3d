## This is My [AngularAttack](https://www.angularattack.com) 2016 Repo

This repo is the start of my AngularAttack 2016 entry. 

### Step 1) My Local Environment setup

* Install the latest [Node / NPM](https://nodejs.org).

* `git clone git@github.com:rumblex/angularattack2016-julius.git`

* `cd angularattack2016-julius`

* `npm install`

* `npm start` will start the server locally to test that everything is running correctly


### Step 2) To Deploy My App

 what I **can** do is deploy this sample app to [Surge](https://surge.sh) (the competition hosting provider).

* `npm install -g surge`

* `surge .`

Note: please do not remove the `CNAME` file, as that tells it where to deploy to.

If you receive an error message `"You do not have permission to publish to julius.2016.angularattack.io"`, it might mean another team member has already deployed your project to Surge. Ask them to run the next step to give you access.
